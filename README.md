Are you a lecturer or tutor? AlphaNomad is a web and mobile-based application to make your life easier! AlphaNomad is designed to track the number of hours and the courses that a tutor has tutored. This will also assist the lecturers in determining the amount that is owed to a particular tutor. The application will also allow the lecturer to assign tutors to courses according to the tutor preferences.
