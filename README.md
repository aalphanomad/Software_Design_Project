Are you a lecturer or tutor? AlphaNomad is a web and mobile-based application to make your life easier! AlphaNomad is designed to keep track of the tutoring contributions of each user. This will assist faculty in determining how much is owed to a particular tutor. The application will also allow the admin to assign tutors to courses according to the tutors' preferences. Tutors will be able to download a PDF of their claims. Tutors will be able to upload their transcripts via the application which the admin will be able to view at any time.
